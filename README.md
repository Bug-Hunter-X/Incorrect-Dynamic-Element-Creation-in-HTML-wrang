# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect Dynamic Element Creation

This repository demonstrates a subtle yet important bug related to dynamically creating and adding HTML elements using JavaScript.  The code attempts to add a new `<div>` element to the page, but does so incorrectly, resulting in unexpected behavior. The solution provides the correct approach.

## Bug Description
The bug lies in the way the new div element is created. The `document.createElement()` method is used with an incorrect string argument, preventing the element from being correctly created and appended to the DOM.
